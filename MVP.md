### Minimum Viable Product

The goal is to find the best subway stations to place street teams to hand out flyers to the gala. 
We are assuming the stations with the highest traffic are the best ones. 
In addition, let's try to find stops that are more likely to be *commuter* as opposed to tourists; tourists are unlikely to be in 
town the night of the gala. 
Thus, Iâ€™m looking at stations that have high traffic during morning and evening rush hours, approximately 8 to 9 am in the morning and 5 to 8 
in the evening. 

Below is the graph of the highest average **entries** at around 8 am in the morning. 

Below is the graph of the highest average **exits** at around 5 pm in the evening. 

A couple of things to note:
- Journal Square is a transportation hub and therefore may be accurate. 
- The graphs do not agree. This is likely due to the time range difference between the two graphs.

# Still to do
I will be looking at the exits in the morning and the entries in the evening
